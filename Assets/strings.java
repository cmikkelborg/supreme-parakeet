// STRINGS

// when working with strings they can be declared empty and declared later
Strings firstName, lastName;
firstName = "Charles";
lastName = "Mikkelborg";

// string concatenation is process of combining two or more STRINGS
System.out.println("My name is" + firstName + " " + lastName); // prints "My name is Charles Mikkelborg"
