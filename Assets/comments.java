// COMMENTS

// There are a few methods for commenting in Java
// the "//" declares a single line comment

// they can be placed on their own line
x = 5; // or they can be placed after code

// as with C++ '/*' and '*/' are used to declare multi-line comments

/* MULTI LINE COMMENT
hi!!
every thing between is commented out
boo
*/

// there are also documentation comments that generate external documentation

/** this is a documentation comment */
/** they work similarly
to muly line comments */

/*************
this is also a valid way to create boxed commenting
Java will simply ignore the extra astriks
